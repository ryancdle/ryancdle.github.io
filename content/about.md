I'm Dat (Ryan), a Final-year Theoretical Physics student at The University of Sheffield.

Currently, I am researching **photonic quantum machine learning** and **generative modelling** as part of the [Quantum Discovery of Science (QuDOS) Group](https://kyriienko.github.io/index.html) at the [Sheffield Quantum Centre](https://quantum.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/home). This work is part of my Master's thesis, under the supervision of QuDOS group leader [Professor Oleksandr Kyriienko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksandr-kyriienko/). 

During summer 2025, I interned at the UCL Quantum Computation & Quantum Communications CDT (Centre for Doctoral Training), where I conducted research on variational Hamiltonian-simulation quantum algorithms under the supervision of PhD Candidate [Prashati Tiwari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prashasti-tiwari-b61342170/) and [Professor Sougato Bose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sougato-bose-991025286/).
