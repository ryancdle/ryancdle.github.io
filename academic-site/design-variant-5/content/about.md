I'm Dat Chi Le (Ryan), a final-year theoretical physics student at the University of Sheffield researching quantum computing and machine learning. I'm currently working as a Quantum Computing Intern at UCL CDT and contributing to Quantum Machine Learning research at the Sheffield Quantum Centre.

My research focuses on exploring how quantum computers can learn and discover new phenomena in our quantum-mechanical universe, bridging the gap between theoretical physics and practical quantum applications.
