I'm Dat Chi Le (Ryan), a final-year theoretical physics student at the University of Sheffield researching quantum computing and machine learning. I'm currently working as a Quantum Computing Intern at UCL CDT and contributing to Quantum Machine Learning research at the Sheffield Quantum Centre.

My research focuses on exploring how quantum computers can learn and discover new phenomena in our quantum-mechanical universe, bridging the gap between theoretical physics and practical quantum applications.

## Research Interests

My research aims to build a rigorous foundation for understanding how scientists, machines, and future quantum computers can learn and discover new phenomena governing our quantum-mechanical universe.

I leverage quantum information theory, quantum many-body physics, learning theory, and complexity theory to formalize and explore new questions in the following directions:

- When can quantum machines learn and predict better than classical machines?
- How to accelerate/automate the development of quantum and physical sciences?
- What physical phenomena can classical vs quantum machines learn and discover?

My ultimate goal is to build quantum machines capable of discovering new facets of our universe beyond the capabilities of humans and classical machines.
